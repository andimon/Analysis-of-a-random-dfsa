## Information about this assignment.

In this assignment we are set out to: 
> Create a random DFSA based on a given recipe (see documentation).

> Computing the depth of the DFSA.

> Minimise the DFSA using Hopcroft's Algorithm.

> Find Strongly Connected Components using Tarjan's Algorithm.

> Finding all elementary cycles in DFSA using Johnson's Algorithm.
  

## Thanks :smiley:
